# Game CI pipeline

1. Code Structure

 * There will be 3 repos used:
   * Project Private repo : Main code base - Cloned from [this](https://github.com/Nowhere-Know-How/PipelineTemplate) template
   * Project-Releases Public repo 1 : Release repo - Created automatically via Workflow
   * Project.github.io Public repo 2 : Hosting GitHub Page and provide download link - Previously setup to host uploads

2. General Development Flow
    1. Developer writes code locally on feature branch.
    2. Developer commit change, push feature branch to GitHub.
    3. Create pull request.
    4. As the request is merged into main branch, Git Action Workflow will be triggered. 

3. Workflow Stages
    1. Unit test :
        * Failed : Upload artifact
        * Passed : Continue
    2. Build project
    3. Create release and attach build file
    4. Create post in GitHub page with link
    * If failed : Send Discord notification




4. Setup

    * Unity Token
  
        1. Request Activation File
        
            Use the git action below for the initial request of activation file. Update the UNITY_VERSION if needed.

            ```
            name: Acquire activation file
            on: 
            pull_request: {}
            push: { branches: [main] }

            env:
                UNITY_VERSION: 2020.1.13f1

            jobs:
            activation:
                name: Request manual activation file ðŸ”‘
                runs-on: ubuntu-latest
                steps:

                - name: Request manual activation file
                    id: getManualLicenseFile
                    uses: webbertakken/unity-request-manual-activation-file@v1.1
                    with:
                    unityVersion: ${{ env.UNITY_VERSION }}

                - name: Expose as artifact
                    uses: actions/upload-artifact@v1
                    with:
                    name: ${{ steps.getManualLicenseFile.outputs.filePath }}
                    path: ${{ steps.getManualLicenseFile.outputs.filePath }}
            ```

            Next part, make sure to specify the Unity version the team agreed for the project.


        2. Once the action is executed, go to action history to find the *.alf file created as an artifact. Be aware it might be created as a zip file
        3. Visit [Unity](https://license.unity3d.com/manual) to activate the token. You will need to sign-in and upload the *.alf file
        4. You will get to download a *.ulf file that contains the license
        5. Go to the repo `Settings` and find `Secret` section
        6. Create a secret called `UNITY_TOKEN` and add the content from *.ulf file
   
    * Github Token


      1. If there is not a Machine User Token for the Organization
         1. Create a new github account for a Machine User
         2. Add the Machine User to the Organization
         3. Create a personal access token
            - https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token
      2. Retrieve the Machine User Token for the Organization
      3. Create a secret called `ACCESS_TOKEN` and add the secret token as content

    * Discord Token  (0.0.260)
        1. Click the dropdown for your discord server
        2. Go to `Server Settings`
        3. Go to `Integration`
        4. Select `Create Webhook`
        5. Once webhook is created, `Copy Webhook URL`
        6. The URL will look like the following `https://discord.com/api/webhooks/{WEBHOOK_ID}/{WEBHOOK_TOKEN}`
        7. Create 2 secret `WEBHOOD_ID` and `WEBHOOK_TOKEN` and fill the value from above URL accordingly

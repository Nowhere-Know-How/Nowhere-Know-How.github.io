# Game CI pipeline

This document is documenting the step-by-step to setup a Game CI pipepine with GitHub Actions

This Game CI pipeline require the following:
 - GitHub account
 - Unity account
 - Discord server

1. Setup

   1. Create repos

        The pipeline requires 3 repos to be created: 
        **PROJECT** will be your game name, and the other repos are names after your game name. You may use the same github page for multiple games as well. For simplicity we are showing how to use it just for one game project. When creating repo **PROJECT-Releases**, make sure the repo is not totally empty. Having a README.md will be sufficient to prevent error when cloning the repo later in workflow.

        - **PROJECT** : One private repo as your main code base
        - **PROJECT-Releases** : One public repo as your release repo
        - **PROJECT.github.io** : One public repo as your github page base to share the update

   2. Obtain tokens

4. Setup
    * Unity Token


      In the **PROJECT** you need to setup the following github workflow to get the Unity toekn for building your project. GitHub workflow will be saved in `.github/workflows` in **PROJECT** repo as yaml file. 
  

        1. Request Activation File
        
            Use the git action below for the initial request of activation file. Update the UNITY_VERSION if needed.
            {% raw %}
            ```
            name: Acquire activation file
            on: 
              pull_request: {}
              
            # Next part, make sure to specify the Unity version the team agreed for the project. **Make sure the version of Unity is available**
            
            env:
               UNITY_VERSION: 2020.1.13f1
            jobs:
                activation:
                    name: Request manual activation file ðŸ”‘
                    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
                    steps:
                      - name: Request manual activation file
                        id: getManualLicenseFile
                        uses: webbertakken/unity-request-manual-activation-file@v1.1
                        with:
                          unityVersion: ${{ env.UNITY_VERSION }}
            # The following section simply upload the downloaded alf file as an artifact. (file name will look like this : Unity_v20XX.X.XXXX.alf)
                     - name: Expose as artifact
                       uses: actions/upload-artifact@v1
                       with:
                         name: ${{ steps.getManualLicenseFile.outputs.filePath }}
                         path: ${{ steps.getManualLicenseFile.outputs.filePath }}
            ```
            {% endraw %}
        2. Once the action is executed, a user with write permission can go to action history to find the *.alf file created as an artifact at the bottom of the succesful build. Be aware it can be created as a zip file and you have to unzip it before the next step.
        3. Visit [Unity](https://license.unity3d.com/manual) to activate the token. You will need to sign-in and upload the *.alf file
        4. You will get to download a *.ulf file that contains the license
        5. Go to the repo `Settings` and find `Secret` section
        6. Create a secret called `UNITY_LICENSE` and add the content from *.ulf file
   
    * Github Token
          
      Depending on the ownership and the role of the user to the repos, you may need to setup multiple Github tokens. The easiest way is to get a token from a user with access to all three repos. The username and email of the token owner will be needed when setting up workflow later. 
      
      Here we take an easier approach : Create a machine user and grant access at an org level, and create all three repos under the org. In such case it we can manage permissions of three repos at org level.

      If there is not a Machine User Token for the Organization 
         1. Create a new github account for a Machine User
         2. Add the Machine User to the Organization
         3. Create a personal access token
            - https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token
      1. Retrieve the Machine User Token for the Organization
      2. Create a secret called `ACCESS_TOKEN` and add the secret token as content


    * Discord Token  (0.0.260)

      Discord token is for build status update. Assuming you already have a discord server you have the access or the permission from the owner. 
    
        1. Click the dropdown for your discord server
        2. Go to `Server Settings`
        3. Go to `Integration`
        4. Select `Create Webhook`
        5. Once webhook is created, `Copy Webhook URL`
        6. The URL will look like the following `https://discord.com/api/webhooks/{WEBHOOK_ID}/{WEBHOOK_TOKEN}`
        7. Create 2 secret `WEBHOOD_ID` and `WEBHOOK_TOKEN` and fill the value from above URL accordingly


   3.  Setup GitHub page: In **PROJECT.github.io**, you will be using it for an external facing blog. The easiest approach is to set it up as a github page. Under setting of the repo, you will find a section for github page where you can select different themes. You can see more details on how to [setup the github page with *Jekyll*](https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll) , and in this example our download link will simply be posted on index.md, but depending on how your repo is structured you will want to update the content of post, the file, and the directory. *This will change how you setup workflow in **PROJECT***

    1. Setup workflow in **PROJECT**

       This workflow will be triggered by pull request or when change is pushed to main
        {% raw %}
        ```
        name: Build, test, and release project

        on:
          pull_request: {}
          # push: { branches: [main] }
          # Set environmental variable for the following actions
        env:
          ORG_NAME: # Your game name
          BLOG_REPO: # Repo where the blog post will be updated
          GITHUB_USER: # User name used for the following actions
          UNITY_VERSION: 2020.1.13.f1
        jobs:
          test:
              name: Unit Tests
              runs-on: ubuntu-latest
              steps:
                # Checkout
                - name: Checkout repository

                # If test fails
                - name: Upload Artifacts on Test Failure
                  if: ${{ failure() }}
                  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v1
                  with:
                    name: Test results
                    path: artifacts

        build:

        {% endraw %}
   


2. General Development Flow
    1. Developer writes code locally on feature branch.
    2. Developer commit change, push feature branch to GitHub.
    3. Create pull request.
    4. As the request is merged into main branch, Git Action Workflow will be triggered. 

3. Workflow Stages
    1. Unit test :
        * Failed : Upload artifact
        * Passed : Continue
    2. Build project
    3. Create release and attach build file
    4. Create post in GitHub page with link
    * If failed : Send Discord notification
